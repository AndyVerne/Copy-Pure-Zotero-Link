# Copy-Pure-Zotero-Link
A translator .js file for just copy the Zotero Link via key binding of Zotero

## Motivation
1. Use the zotero link so that you don't need to worry about the file location, just generate the link, put it in the browser, it will open it for you. :)
2. To generate/copy zotero link directly, I create the simple .js file as a translator in Zotero.

## How to use it
1. Put the .js file in the `translators` folder of Zotero software
2. Restart Zotero
3. In the preferences of Zotero, change the default format of `Export` to `Pure Zotero Link for Copy`
4. Use the `control + shift + C` to just copy the zotero link, it will generate link like this: 'zotero://select/items/0_LBXHZKH7'
